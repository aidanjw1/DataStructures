This project is a java implementation of a graph to solve
changlings puzzles; it finds a path from one word to another
by cnanging one letter at time - while each intermediate word
is also a legitimate word.

To run this program, compile the java classes and run the
Changeling class with the wordlist.txt and words as arguments:

    java Changeling wordlist.txt apple round
