**The file "plotunsorted.list" is too large to push to github,
however it can be downloaded using this link so that the program
can be run:

    http://aidanjwhite.com/res/plotunsorted.list.zip


This project is an implementation of a binary search tree which allows
users to search for movie plot descriptions using data from  IMDb

To run the project, compile the java files and run the TreeSearchEngine
class with the text file data as an argument:

    java TreeSearchEngine plotunsorted.list
